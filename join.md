Testbed resources can only be used under the terms and conditions of the [acceptable use policy](../aup).

Please also join the [users mailing list](http://lists.uni-kl.de/tomato-lab/info/users). This list will be used for all announcenments and can also be used to get help from other users.

## Institutions

The testbed is run by the ToMaTo consortium on a cooperative model. This means that academic institutions can join the testbed **for free** if they contribute resources to the testbed. Please see the page [node requirements](node_requirements) for information on requirements on contributed resources. The page [organization roles](roles) describes the different roles that exist and the responsibilities and tasks of the assigned persons.

The membership agreement is currently being designed, please stay tuned and watch the news.
