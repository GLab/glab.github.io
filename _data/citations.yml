- text: German Lab (G-Lab) is an initiative on the Future Internet sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It uses PlanetLab-compliant technology and has deployed a testbed in Germany. Based on G-Lab, the topology management tool (ToMaTo) provides a graphical user interface that allows users to design and use a virtual network by simply dragging and organizing network device and link icons.
