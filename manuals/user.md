This is the ToMaTo user manual. It is aimed at experimenters that want to make use of an existing testbed infrastructure.

## Quick Start

If you want to do a quick start and you already have access to the ToMaTo testbed, you should work through the [ToMaTo tutorials](https://master.tomato-lab.org/tutorial). They provide an interactive guide to create your first topologies and try out the most important features of ToMaTo.

## Accessing ToMaTo

In order to access the ToMaTo testbed, you need an activated [user account](account). If you are reading this, you probably have the intention to use a running ToMaTo installation. If your installation is not the [official ToMaTo testbed](https://master.tomato-lab.org), please refer to your respective contact person about how to access it.

ToMaTo offers two different methods to access it: The _webfrontend_ and the _API_.

The webfrontend is a fully functional, intuitive client with a graphical [topology editor](topology/editor) running in your web browser. There is no need to install any software on your computer when accessing the testbed via the webfrontend.

The [API}(api) is an RPC-based interface for any program to connect to ToMaTo directly. It is possible to conduct completely automated experiments by writing scripts which make use of the ToMaTo API.
There is a [command-line client](cli) which can access the ToMaTo API in a python shell.

## About This Manual

All links in this manual link to the official ToMaTo testbed. If you are using a different installation, please modify the links accordingly before clicking on them.

If not stated otherwise, all instructions are giving for using the webfrontend.
