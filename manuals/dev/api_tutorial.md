# API Tutorials

This is a set of tutorials which should help you to learn how to use the API.
The tutorials are a step-by-step guide on how to get certain things done.

The first tutorials will focus on the [command-line interface](../tools/cli) (CLI), while later tutorials will teach you how to write your own scripts. You can finish "Getting Started" without knowledge about Python, but you should work through the [Python tutorials](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/) before starting scripting.

The tutorials will not contain many links to the API reference. It is your responsibility to look up the documentation if you are unsure about certain functions.

## Getting Started

First, you should [install the ToMaTo tools](../tools).

* [Introduction](introduction) - Log in to the CLI and access your data. Get help from the graphical topology editor
* [First Topology](first_topology) - Create and use a topology manually
* [Topology Import and Executable Archives](executable_archive) - Import of a topology and batch upload of executable archives

## Scripting

* [CLI Scripting](cli_scripts) - run a completely automated experiment in ToMaTo
* Connecting to the API
