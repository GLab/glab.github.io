# Topology Permissions

It is possible to share [topologies](..) between different user accounts. Permissions can be controlled in the [editor](../editor) by opening the _Permissions Window_ by clicking on the "Users & Permissions" button in the _Topology_ tab.

You should not share your user account with other people. Instead, every person should have their own account, and topologies should be shared between these accounts, if necessary.

## Roles

Users can have multiple _roles_ in the topology:

* *user*: the user has access to elements' consoles, and can use [executable archives](../../element/executable_archive).
* *manager*: _user_ permissions, plus the possibility to conduct [actions](../../element/action) to control the topology.
* *owner*: Full access to every functionality of the topology.
