Programmable Devices (Repy)

Programmable devices are essentially scripts that can work with networking packages. These scripts can be written in a Python dialect called [[Repy]] and can read and write raw Ethernet packets to/from their network interfaces. Programmable devices are very light-weight as they are just small Python scripts.

Repy is a turing-complete subset of Python that allows to run in a sandboxed environment.
ToMaTo adds the following functionality to Repy:

 * Reading raw packets from networking devices
 * Writing raw packets to networking devices
 * Listing networking devices and information retrieval
 * Encoding and decoding byte structures using the [struct library](http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html)

### Emulated Virtual Hardware
The only virtual hardware of Programmable Devices are their networking devices. These devices can handle Ethernet packets up to 1514 Bytes.

### Console
For Programmable Devices, the console only displays the output of the script but does not allow any input.

Additionally to the console, this log is also available as a full log for download.

### Images
The Repy scripts of the device can be uploaded and downloaded as [images](../image). A quick sanity check will be performed before the upload.

To learn more about the creation of Repy script, consult the [developer's manual](/manuals/dev).

## <a name="config"></a> Configuration Window

### Name

The on-screen name of the device. This setting will not affect your experiment.

### Site

[Site](../../../site_host) that this element will be deployed to.

### Performance Profile

[Device profile](../profile) that will applied to this element.

### Template

[Template](../template) that will be used when [preparing](../../action#prepare) this element. When your device is [prepared](../..#state), you can exchange the template.

{:.alert .alert-warning}
Changing the template of a _prepared_ device will delete all existing data on the device's current disk image.

### Segment separation

[TODO]

### Custom Icon

Select a URL to a custom icon for this device to be shown in the editor. The icon should be a 32x32 PNG image.

ToMaTo offers a set of pre-defined custom icons under _Custom Element Icons_ in the main menu's _Resources_ menu. [â†’ go now](https://master.tomato-lab.org/web_resources/custom_element_icons/)

### Arguments

Arguments that are passed to the script.

## <a name="interface_config"></a> Interfaces' Configuration Window

### Name

The interface's device name on its host (e.g., "eth0")
