# Device Profiles

Device profiles define the available performance of your [devices](../device). [TODO: expand]

Without a restriction, a user may be able to completely congest a host, making other elements on the same host impossible to use.
To avoid such congestion, the performance of devices is constrained by device profiles. You can select a device profile from the device's configuration window.

Device profiles can limit the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, and the maximum disk space. The exact limitations depend on the device type.

A list of available profiles can be seen at _Device Profiles_ under _Resources_ in the main menu ([â†’ go now](https://master.tomato-lab.org/web_resources/executable_archive/)). By default, users have access only to the default profiles. If you need more performant devices, your administrator can grant you access to all profiles.


## Determine or Change a Device's Profile

To see which device profile a device has, open its config menu and locate the respective information. You can also change it here.
