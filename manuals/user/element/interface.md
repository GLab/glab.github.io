# Interface Elements

Interface elements are special elements that are attached to other elements and represent their inidividual network interfaces. They form a child-parent relationship with their parent elements.

## Creation and Deletion

The editor automatically creates and deletes interface elements with their respective connection. Interface elements area also deleted with their parent element.


## Interaction

Interface elements are represented by small circles around their parent elements. Note that you can interact with them via their right-click menu like you can interact with any other elements.

[TODO: insert image]

If the interface is not visible on your connections, make sure that _Connection Controls_ are enabled in the editor's _Options_ Menu tab.

## Right-Click Menu

[TODO]

## Actions

Interface elements do not support [actions](../action) themselves. They change their [states](..#state) automatically with their parentes.

## Configuration

Configuration options highly depend on the device type of the parent device. Please refer to the specific manual page for more information.
