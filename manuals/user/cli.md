# Command-Line Interface

ToMaTo's command-line interface (CLI) is a [Python](https://python.org) shell with integrated ToMaTo [API](../api) commands. The ToMaTo API follows an RPC scheme, making it easy to understand.

## Help and Tab-Completion

The CLI supports tab completion. When you type in an entity (e.g., "element") and press the tab key multple times, you get suggestions about functions.

You can type `help(function_name)` (e.g., `help(element_create)`) to see the specifications of this particular API function.

## API tutorials

The [developer's manual](/manuals/dev) contains tutorials about the usage of the API
