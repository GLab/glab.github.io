# Device Template

## Introduction
A device template defines the contents of a device's disk as it is prepared.

Essentially, a template is a [disk image](../disk_image).

Most templates contains pre-installed operating system with small configuration changes to optimize running inside ToMaTo.
Every Templates has a description which may contain important information about the system configuration.

If ToMaTo does not offer a template for your target operating system, you can change the device's disk image any time after preparing the device.

## Editor
To change a device's template in the editor, right-click on it and select "configure". In the opening window, you can change the template from a dropdown list.
