# KVM devices

## Introduction
KVM (**K**ernel-based **V**irtual **M**achine) is a virtualization infrastructure for Linux. It supports Linux, Windows and many other guest operating systems.

Since, unlike OpenVZ, it virtualizes the guest system's kernel, there is no limit to the manipulation of the guest system's kernel.
