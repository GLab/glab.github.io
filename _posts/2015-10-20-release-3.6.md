Today we released version 3.6 of ToMaTo. This new version contains among minor bugfixes and improvements the following major changes:

* New database in backend: MongoDB, this should resolve many problems and increase performance
* New design in web-interface and updated Jquery
* Updated templates

As this was a huge change, we are currently working on some remaining issues including performance issues, they should be resolved shortly.
Please report bugs and feature requests on the [Github issue tracker](http://github.org/GLab/ToMaTo/issues) or via mail to [support@tomato-lab.org](mailto:support@tomato-lab.org)
