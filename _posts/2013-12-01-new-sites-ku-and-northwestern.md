We are proud to welcome our new partners in ToMaTo: Kansas University (ku) and Northwestern (northwestern).
Both partners participate in ToMaTo with 2 nodes each. 
Those nodes can be accessed by all users from now on by selecting the respective sites.
The new sites can also be seen in the [sites map](http://master.tomato-lab.org/map).
