Today, we have released a new version of ToMaTo: 4.0.
The most notable changes are:

 * Drastically improved response times and overall speed by distributing the backend over different services
 * Now using a more reliable tamplate distribution strategy across hosts
 * Switches now use VpnCloud by default

The upgrade should not have affected running experiments.
We hope that the upgrade process went smoothly, and that you can now use ToMaTo with improved response times. If you run into any issues with the new version, please let us know.
