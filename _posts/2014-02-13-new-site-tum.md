Today we welcome the University of Munich in Germany as a new site in
ToMaTo. The University of Munich is a major partner in the German-Lab
project and is now up and running with 5 nodes in ToMaTo. 
Those nodes can be accessed by all users from now on by selecting the respective site.
The new site can also be seen in the [sites map](http://master.tomato-lab.org/map).
