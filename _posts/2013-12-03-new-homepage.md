The ToMaTo project has found a new home at **tomato-lab.org**. This includes

* a website at [www.tomato-lab.org](http://www.tomato-lab.org)
* the master server which is now available at [master.tomato-lab.org](http://master.tomato-lab.org)
* the package respository which is now available at [packages.tomato-lab.org](http://packages.tomato-lab.org)

We also have three new email addresses:

* <info@tomato-lab.org> as a general contact address
* <support@tomato-lab.org> for support questions
* <abuse@tomato-lab.org> for abuse notifications

And we have two new mailing lists:

* <users@tomato-lab.org>, an open mailing list for general user discussions, user-to-user support and general announcements
* <devs@tomato-lab.org>, a closed mailing list for all developers and host administrators

Registration for these mailing lists is possible under [lists.uni-kl.de/tomato-lab/lists](http://lists.uni-kl.de/tomato-lab/lists)
