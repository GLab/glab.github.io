On the 18th of July we will update ToMaTo to version 4.0. This new version focuses on stability and performance.

On that day and maybe during the next few days, ToMaTo might not or only partly reachable. We work hard to make the update as smooth as possible.
Experiments should continue to run during that but might be temporarily inaccessible. There should be no data loss because of the update, however we urge users to backup any important data (using the "topology export" and "image download" features).
