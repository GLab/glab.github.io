Today we welcome the University of Darmstadt in Germany as a new site in
ToMaTo. The University of Darmstadt is a major partner in the German-Lab
project and is now up and running with 28 nodes in ToMaTo. 
Those nodes can be accessed by all users from now on by selecting the respective site.
The new site can also be seen in the [sites map](http://master.tomato-lab.org/map).
The total node count in ToMaTo is now 122.
