  <h2>Institutions</h2>

  <p>The testbed is run by the ToMaTo consortium on a cooperative model. This means that academic institutions can join the testbed <strong>for free</strong> if they contribute resources to the testbed. Please see the page <a href="node_requirements">node requirements</a> for information on requirements on contributed resources.</p>

  <p>The membership agreement is currently being designed, please stay tuned and watch the news.</p>
